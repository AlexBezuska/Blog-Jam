## Community Game Jam Blogpost Generator
(currently only ludumdare.com)
### by [Alex Bezuska](https://twitter.com/abezuska)

##### Project started: 2016.12.21

This is a tool intended to help #gamedev communities and game dev spaces like ours ([Warp Zone Louisville](http://warpzonelouisville.com)) to easily show off the awesome games made by our community each time we participate in a game jam. The tool takes a provided list of game page urls and pulls out the title, author, screenshots, and description, and creates an html file that can be copied into a blog.

Example of finished output html (using the provided `bootstrap.html` template):

## How to use:

### Overview:
I have two included templates `bootstrap.html` (if your blog has bootstrap) and `minimal-styling.html` or `raw.html` (which includes some minimal css) to get you started. Create your own by duplicating an existing template. This project uses [request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request), and [cheerio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheerio) to scrape data from game jam websites (currently only ludumdare.com).

### Instructions:

* Install node (instructions for your OS here: https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Clone this repository or download the zip
* Duplicate `config.sample.js` and name it `config.json`
* Open `config.json` in your text editor and replace the jamURL and game urls your own (currently only ludumdare.com urls work). (see `config.json` help below for help)
* Navigate to this project in your terminal
* Run the program using `node index.js`
* You will notice a file added to the `./output` directory called `blog-post.html` (or whatever you named the `outputFile` in config)
* Open the output html in your browser to make sure everything is working
* Copy html into your blog post (see note for WordPress users below if you are having strange formatting issues)

**Note for WordPress users:**
When copying html into a blog post, WordPress loves to do things like insert `<br/>` tags and automatically put things in paragraphs, this can really jack up the formatting of the post. To address this I really recommend you use the free plugin [Raw HTML by Janis Elsts](https://wordpress.org/plugins/raw-html/) which allows you to check boxes to disable all of those settings for each post, example:

### `config.json` help

* `urls` - currently this program only works with ludumdare.com game pages
* `ordering`
  * `"default"` - games will be presented in order of the urls in the array
  * `"alpha"` - games will be in alphabetical order by title


## Contributing

Please do not hesitate to submit pull requests, I would love this to be a community effort. The game dev community is all about helping each other out and I want to offer this tool as a starting point to build something greater.
Check the Github issues for ways to help that I already have on my radar, but here are a few important issues:
* I would love help to add the capability to scrape other game jam sites to this project â€“ Global Game Jam and Itch would be fantastic additions

## Versioning

I would like to use SemVer but I need to research how to do that a bit more.
